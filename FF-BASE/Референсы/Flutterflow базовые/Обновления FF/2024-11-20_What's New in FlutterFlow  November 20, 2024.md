**File Download Action**

It‚Äôs easier than ever to give users the ability to download files within your app! The new **File Download action** allows you to specify the URL or bytes variable that should be downloaded, and gives you the ability to name the file.

You can learn more about how to use this action, and other file related actions, in the [FlutterFlow documentation](https://docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/file-handling/download-file).

**Updates to Reset Password Flow (Firebase & Supabase)**

"Reset Password" action has been renamed to "Send Reset Password Email" - to better reflect its intended usage which is to send the reset password email to a user.¬†

In Supabase, this sends a magic link that will authenticate the current user into your app. In Firebase, this sends an email that goes to a change-password webpage hosted by Firebase.

We‚Äôve also added a new "Update Password" action, that takes the new password as input, and updates the current authenticated user's password in either Firebase or Supabase.¬†

For Supabase projects, you must create a page in your app to actually handle the new password logic using this action.

For Firebase projects, you can rely on the change-password page provided by Firebase, or create your own page in your app.¬†

[You can see details in our documentation](https://docs.flutterflow.io/integrations/authentication/supabase/auth-actions/#reset-password-action).

**onDragStarted + onDragCancel**

Two new action triggers have been added for the [Draggable](https://docs.flutterflow.io/resources/ui/widgets/built-in-widgets/draggable/) widget - onDragStarted and onDragCancel, which are called when the draggable widget has begun to be dragged, and when a drag is interrupted.

This allows you to build more complex draggable experiences within your app.¬†
